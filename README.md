## 📌 Project Overview
The **Interactive Quiz Application** is a dynamic web-based tool designed to test user knowledge through multiple-choice questions. Built during a 4-week internship at Codtech IT Solutions, this project demonstrates core front-end development skills including semantic HTML structure, responsive CSS design, and interactive JavaScript logic.

The goal was to create a clean, engaging, and functional quiz interface that could be easily extended with features like timers, themes, and custom question sets.

## ✨ Features

Multiple-choice questions with radio button selection  
Score tracking and final result display  
Navigation through questions using a "Next" button  
Responsive layout for desktop and mobile  
Alert for unanswered questions  
Clean and intuitive UI

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
**HTML5** – for semantic structure  
**CSS3** – for styling and layout  
**JavaScript (Vanilla)** – for dynamic functionality  
**VS Code** – development environment  
**Live Server** – for real-time preview

## 🎨 Design Choices
The design focuses on simplicity and clarity. A centered quiz container with soft shadows and rounded corners creates a modern look. The color scheme uses calming blues and whites to keep users focused. Typography is clean and readable, and the layout adapts smoothly across screen sizes.

## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions
**Dynamic rendering of questions**: Solved using modular JavaScript functions like `loadQuestion()` and `showScore()`.
**Preventing empty submissions**: Handled with input validation and alert prompts.
**File linking issues**: Resolved by understanding relative paths and folder structure.

## 🚀 Outcome

This project strengthened my understanding of front-end development and DOM manipulation. It also taught me how to structure code for scalability and maintainability. I’m proud to have built a fully functional quiz app and excited to explore enhancements like timers, themes, and backend integration.
